# Hackspace Portal

Welcome!

This repository contains the source code for the Hackspace Portal: a small website used to keep track of everything members are up to in the hackspace. 

Whether you're a seasoned hacker, a novice tinkerer, or simply curious about the world of making, this portal is your gateway to a vibrant community of like-minded individuals (nice intro ChatGPT).

## Purpose of the Portal

The portal serves as a point of administration for all members. It is commonly used for:

- **Membership Administration**: Enrol members, manage personal details, forum accounts and references to payment information.
- **Access Cards**: Associate access cards with members and revoke them remotely.
- **Inductions**: Pass a test to gain access to some of the more scary machines, then unlock them with your card.
- **Storage Labels**: Track short term storage labels.

## Getting Started

See the `docs` folder for some guidance on setting up your dev environment and creating your first user.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from all members of the community! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there are plenty of ways to get involved. If you have ideas for new features, encounter any bugs, or simply want to help improve the platform, we'd love to hear from you.
